# domoticz-tplink-hs100-hs110-v2
This is a repo for another TP-Link HS100/HS110 plugin for Domoticz (if the v1 is not working obviously)

- Copy this plugin in the folder domoticz/plugins/tplink-smartplug-v2
- Restart the domoticz service or reboot your server
- In Domoticz, create a new Hardware, select this plugin, specify the IP address and type of your smartplug

* You can use both versions of the plugin simultaneously in your Domoticz install
